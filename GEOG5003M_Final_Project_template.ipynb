These were selected based on services directly linked to personal health, including leisure facilities which support healthiness <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0114-6\">[1]</a>. Using these five variables a weighted average was created, with weights based on previous studies of services with the largest impact <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0114-6\">[1]</a>, and stored under the code ‘ah4h’.\n",

A yearly mean column under ‘2016_mean’ was created and populated with the mean value of the combined quarterly values. This negated the issue with missing quarterly data while additionally benefiting from the removal of seasonal impact on house pricing <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2785400\">[2]</a>. After creating the mean value, for any rows that remained missing due to a complete missing year, these were removed as there was no way to extrapolate the data accurately from elsewhere.\n",

        "To investigate outliers in the data, descriptive statistics, pair plots and box plots were used. Although all data sets showed some evidence of extreme values, property value showed extreme outliers at the larger end and so these were identified and removed using the interquartile range method. This method was used due to its simplicity and reproducibility at removing outliers so as not to distort the results of the correlation <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772662223000048\">[3]</a>.\n"

        "Initially the CRS of the data frame was converted to EPSG:3857 allowing its use with a basemap. The basemap selected was CartoDB from ‘contexttily’ under the option ‘Positron’. This map provided place names while remaining unobtrusive to the main visualization, and through adding a level of opacity to the choropleth maps, provides local context to the audience.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Virdis color palette was used for the clusters as this was designed to be easily distinguishable by individuals with common forms of color blindness <a href=\"https://pos.sissa.it/guidelines.pdf\">[8]</a> while still offering differentiation in color. Also, due to the nature of the data a not too strong sequential palette was preferable.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the weighted mean access, magma was chosen as another palette that offers accessibility to people with common forms of colorblindness but differentiates it from the other choropleth map and offers a stronger sense of sequentiality <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/colors/colormaps.html\">[9]</a>.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some final aesthetic choices that were made for useability were that on both maps’ axis were removed as these overcomplicated the plots, a North Arrow was added to aid in locality, the legend was moved to ensure none of the map area was covered, and finally the color bar was resized to offer enough detail while not overpowering the map.\n"

        "At the smaller LSOA scale the correlation is far more variable and less conclusive, while at the aggregated LAD scale a negative correlation is much more pronounced.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second is that at both scales’ dentists, leisure centers and pharmacies have a stronger correlation with house price than GPs or hospitals. This may be due to the private ownership of many of these facilities, where profitability is the focus.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we can observe that there is a spatial component to health access across London, with more central areas providing the best access, while access generally declines as you near the outskirts of the city.  \n"

        "It is the hope that this project provides a useful exploration of how access to healthcare may affect house prices and highlights areas that may require more infrastructural support, however this report also comes with some limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Chief among these is that the data only provides distance to service and not the capacity of the service itself <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0114-6\">[1]</a>. Equally the list of services is not exhaustive, and the report could be improved in further inclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the weighting of the overall distance is based on assumptions of the author and previous research, however exact weighting is difficult to justify <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0114-6\">[1]</a> and therefore could be improved with further research.\n",
