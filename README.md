Health and Wealth. An investigation into the correlation between property value and access to Health Service in London 

Equity of access has been a focus of the NHS since it began in 1948 (Goodard and Smith, 2001) and with most research suggesting that low income has a direct correlation with heath care utilization (Copper et al, 2012), It is clear that lower socio-economic areas require improved access to support its populations. In contrast to this, property value has been shown to increase with proximity to local services, including hospitals and other health care services (Chen et al, 2022), making areas that provide the most support less accessible to the communities that need them most. 
As a result, it is the aim of this investigation to explore how median property value of each Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) in Greater London is affected by the distance to 5 different health services and in relation to a an overall weighted mean distance from health services in each LSOA. This is undertaken with the aim of assisting in regional assessment and policy making to determine if an increase in support and infrastructure may be necessary to support local communities. We will also explore this relationship at the Local Authority District (LAD) spatial scale, to provide support at the borough level where decisions are made within London.
